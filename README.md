# hand-controlled-painter
What does this project do?
this is a hand gesture controlled painter using this you guys can draw anything on the screen just using your index finger and webcam no need for any touch screen just in air you can do so.
Controls :
1. C to clear the screen.
2. p to pause the drawing p to start through,( create a straight line from the stopped point to the start point )
3. touch the index finger with thumb for changing color of the drawing line
4. you guys can just draw with your index finger 

Setup: The code initializes OpenCV to capture webcam input, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Pygame for displaying the drawing interface.
Hand Tracking,It processes each frame from the webcam to detect hand landmarks. SpecificaAlly, it tracks the index finger tip, thumb tip, and wrist to draw lines when the finger is moving and to detect gestures like changing drawing color (when the thumb and index finger are close)
this project right now isn't that much sensitive and fully functional cause all the things used in this code are not known by me fully i have to scrap things from the internet Use AI to fullfill some of the features and debugging i do so when there is no data tuto and nothing available in the internet..but after that i try to learn the code myself and make some changes in it....
if something is left to be written here sorry guys i am too tired rn.
